# Protein Data Engineering Pipeline

This project is a modular, containerized data engineering pipeline focused on ingesting, cleaning, and preparing 
protein-related datasets for downstream analysis or machine learning applications. 
It leverages tools like Apache Airflow, Docker, and SQL for orchestration, data processing, and persistence.

## 📦 Project Structure
## 🚀 Features

- Custom Airflow DAGs for ETL workflows
- SQL-based schema initialization
- Dockerized for portable development and deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
- Configurable via environment variables

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- (Optional) Python 3.8+ for local script testing
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/protein_data_eng.git
cd protein_data_eng
Create .env file

Edit the .env file or copy from .env.example to configure credentials and ports.

Start the containers

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
Access Airflow

Once running, open Airflow UI at: http://localhost:8080

🛠️ Usage
Add DAGs to the dags/ folder.

SQL initialization is run via the init.sql script in the database service.

Run scripts: You can run one-off scripts using:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it <service_name> python scripts/your_script.py
🧪 Testing
Tests can be added under a tests/ directory and executed using pytest. Integration tests can be automated via the Jenkinsfile.

📈 Future Improvements
Add data validation steps using Great Expectations or Pydantic

Integrate monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana)

Implement full ML model pipeline
